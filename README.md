Integration with Multiple Databases of AICTE for Coherent Information Retrieval
Project Overview:

This capstone project focuses on integrating multiple heterogeneous databases maintained by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) into a unified platform for coherent and efficient information retrieval.

Currently, AICTE manages various independent databases related to:

Institutions and colleges

Courses and programs

Faculty details

Student information (scholarships, internships, placements)

Schemes, projects, and industry collaborations

Since these systems function in silos, retrieving consistent and consolidated data is a challenge.
This project proposes a solution by designing a data integration and retrieval framework with a single access point for querying and analytics.

🎯 Objectives

Integrate multiple AICTE databases into a centralized or federated system.

Ensure data consistency, coherence, and quality across different datasets.

Provide a unified search interface for students, faculty, institutions, and policymakers.

Enable real-time retrieval of information with support for analytics and visualization.

Ensure secure, role-based access control.

🏛️ About AICTE

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is the apex statutory body under the Ministry of Education, Government of India, responsible for regulating and promoting technical education across disciplines like:

Engineering & Technology

Management

Pharmacy

Architecture & Planning

Applied Arts, Crafts, and Design

AICTE also manages several digital initiatives and portals, including:

AICTE Approval Process Portal

AICTE Internship Portal

Faculty Development and Training Portal

Scholarship Schemes (Pragati, Saksham, PMSSS)

NEAT (National Educational Alliance for Technology)

This project leverages the concept of integrating such distributed systems into a cohesive information retrieval framework.

🏗️ System Architecture
Components:

Data Sources – Multiple AICTE databases (institution, faculty, student, schemes).

Data Integration Layer – ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean and unify data.

Middleware / API Gateway – Provides a single access point and manages role-based queries.

Search & Retrieval Engine – SQL federation, Elasticsearch/Graph DB for intelligent queries.

Frontend Portal – Web-based dashboard with unified search and analytics.

Proposed Tech Stack:

Backend: Java (Spring Boot) / Python (FastAPI, Django)

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB (for unstructured data)

Integration Tools: Apache NiFi / Kafka / Airflow

Search: Elasticsearch / Solr

Frontend: Angular / React

Cloud: AWS / Azure / GCP

🔑 Key Features

✅ Unified search across multiple AICTE databases

✅ ETL-based data integration and cleaning

✅ Coherent and consistent data retrieval

✅ Dashboard with filters, analytics, and visualizations

✅ Secure authentication and authorization

✅ Scalable and modular architecture

🚀 Expected Outcomes

A prototype portal demonstrating integration of multiple AICTE databases.

Single access point for retrieving institution, course, faculty, and student data.

Analytics dashboard for administrators and policymakers.

Enhanced decision-making and user experience compared to siloed systems.

📊 Use Cases

Students – Search for colleges, approved courses, scholarships, and internships.

Faculty – Access details of research collaborations, training programs, and funding schemes.

Institutions – Monitor accreditation, compliance, and faculty records.

AICTE/Government – Formulate policies using integrated datasets.
